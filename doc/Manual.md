# Fractal Visualizer User Manual

This program will draw Julia and Mandelbrot fractal images. You run this from the command line using 
`$ python src/main.py`, this will show you what images you can have the program show by entering a valid name
when running the program like such `$ python src/main.py <valid image name>`.

After running with a valid image name your selection will be drawn and shown, the time it took to draw will be 
displayed in the terminal, and a .png file will be created with the image in the src file. You can then exit the
program by closing the canvas window that the image was drawn on. To draw another fractal you will need to run
the program from the command line with another valid image name.
